## About

I design and deploy practical AI systems that integrate directly into real-world business workflows.  
My focus is applied AI — not demos, but production-ready tools that improve operations, visibility, and decision-making.

Primary domains:
- Automotive retail intelligence
- AI-assisted workflow automation
- Full-stack application architecture
- Real-time data systems
- Human-in-the-loop AI tooling

## Core Capabilities

**AI Systems**
- LLM integration (OpenAI APIs, structured output, tool-calling)
- AI insights engines & recommendation systems
- Prompt engineering for operational reliability
- Real-time inference pipelines

**Backend Engineering**
- Python (FastAPI, async systems)
- Node.js / TypeScript
- REST & event-driven architectures
- WebSocket-based real-time systems
- API orchestration layers

**Frontend & Product**
- React / Next.js
- TypeScript
- UI systems for operational dashboards
- Internal AI tooling interfaces

**Infrastructure**
- Netlify / serverless deployments
- Environment configuration & secure API handling
- Structured logging & observability patterns

## Philosophy

AI should:
- Reduce friction
- Increase clarity
- Integrate into existing workflows
- Deliver measurable operational lift

I build systems with that standard.
